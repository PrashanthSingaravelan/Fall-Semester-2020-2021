Normal forms
1) 1st normal form

2) 2nd normal form
	The relation must be in 1st normal form.
	* No Partial dependency
	Partial dependency : Proper subset of candidate key (Prime attributes) determining Non prime attribute	
Left:Proper-subset of the candidate key 
Right:Non-prime attribute

3) 3rd normal form
	The relation must be in 2nd normal form.
	* No transitive dependency
	Transitive dependency : Non Prime attribute determining Non prime attribute	
Left:Proper-subset of the candidate key 
Right:Prime attribute
